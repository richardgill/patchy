Users should be prompted to confirm before this happens.\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n\n```\n$ patchy repo reset --repo-base-dir repos --repo-dir my-repo\nThis will discard all uncommitted changes in repos/my-repo. Continue? [y/N]\n```\n\n## Flags (following Vercel CLI pattern)\n\n- `--yes` / `-y` - Skip confirmation prompt and proceed\n- Could also respect `--dry-run` to show what would be reset without prompting\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Add `yes` flag to `src/commands/repo/reset/command.ts`\n2. Add `YesCommandFlags` or extend `ResetCommandFlags` in `src/config/types.ts`\n3. Update `src/commands/repo/reset/impl.ts:68` to prompt before `git.reset([\"--hard\"])`\n4. Use `enquirer` (already a dependency) for the prompt\n\n## Example from Vercel CLI\n\n```\n$ vercel rm my-project\n\u003e The project \"my-project\" will be removed permanently.\n?

{"id":"patchy-51","title":"Replace enquirer with @clack/prompts","description":"# Replace enquirer with @clack/prompts\n\n## Overview\n\nReplace the `enquirer` dependency with `@clack/prompts` for CLI prompts. Clack is 80% smaller, has better TypeScript support, and provides a more modern API.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nTwo files use enquirer:\n\n1. **`src/commands/init/impl.ts`** - Uses `input` prompts for:\n   - Repository URL (with validation)\n   - Git ref (with default)\n   - Patches directory (with default)\n\n2. **`src/commands/repo/reset/impl.ts`** - Uses `confirm` prompt for destructive action confirmation\n\nBoth files:\n- Import enquirer as default export, then destructure `prompt`\n- Use `.catch()` for cancellation handling\n- Use TypeScript generics for typed answers\n\n## Desired End State\n\n- `enquirer` removed from dependencies\n- `@clack/prompts` added as dependency\n- Both prompt usages converted to clack API\n- `bun run local-ci` passes (typecheck, check, test)\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Adding new prompts or features\n- Changing the UX flow\n- Adding intro/outro styling (keep it simple)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nClack uses individual function imports rather than a unified `prompt()` call. The mapping:\n- enquirer `input` → clack `text`\n- enquirer `confirm` → clack `confirm`\n- enquirer validation → clack `validate` option\n- enquirer `.catch()` → clack `isCancel()` check\n\n## Phase 1: Update Dependencies\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n```bash\nbun remove enquirer\nbun add @clack/prompts\n```\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Convert init/impl.ts\n\n### File: `src/commands/init/impl.ts`\n\nReplace enquirer import and prompt logic with clack:\n\n**Old pattern:**\n```typescript\nimport enquirer from \"enquirer\";\nconst { prompt } = enquirer;\n// ...\nconst answers = await prompt\u003cPromptAnswers\u003e(questions).catch(() =\u003e {...});\n```\n\n**New pattern:**\n```typescript\nimport * as p from \"@clack/prompts\";\n// ...\n// Sequential prompts with isCancel checks\nconst repoUrl = await p.text({...});\nif (p.isCancel(repoUrl)) { /* handle cancel */ }\n```\n\nKey changes:\n- Import `* as p from \"@clack/prompts\"`\n- Replace conditional question array with sequential `if` blocks\n- Use `p.text()` for input prompts\n- Use `p.isCancel()` to detect cancellation\n- `hint` option maps to `placeholder` in clack\n- `initial` option maps to `initialValue` in clack\n- `validate` function works the same (return string for error, undefined for success)\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Convert repo/reset/impl.ts\n\n### File: `src/commands/repo/reset/impl.ts`\n\n**Old pattern:**\n```typescript\nimport enquirer from \"enquirer\";\nconst { prompt } = enquirer;\n// ...\nconst { confirmed } = await prompt\u003c{ confirmed: boolean }\u003e({\n  type: \"confirm\",\n  name: \"confirmed\",\n  message: \"...\",\n  initial: false,\n}).catch(() =\u003e ({ confirmed: false }));\n```\n\n**New pattern:**\n```typescript\nimport * as p from \"@clack/prompts\";\n// ...\nconst confirmed = await p.confirm({\n  message: \"...\",\n  initialValue: false,\n});\nif (p.isCancel(confirmed)) {\n  // handle cancel - treat as not confirmed\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n- Import `* as p from \"@clack/prompts\"`\n- Use `p.confirm()` directly (returns boolean, not object)\n- Use `p.isCancel()` for cancellation detection\n- `initial` → `initialValue`\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] `bun run local-ci` passes (runs check, typecheck, test in parallel)\n- [ ] No enquirer in package.json dependencies\n- [ ] @clack/prompts in package.json dependencies\n\n### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] `bun run dev init` works interactively\n- [ ] `bun run dev repo reset` shows confirmation prompt\n- [ ] Ctrl+C cancellation works correctly in both commands","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-10T16:15:10.984334519Z","updated_at":"2025-12-10T16:42:15.055153979Z","closed_at":"2025-12-10T16:42:15.055153979Z"}

Users should be able to test any PR with a single curl command.\n\n## User Experience Goal\n\nWhen a developer pushes to a PR, they (and reviewers) see a comment like:\n\n```\n## 🔨 PR Build Ready!\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| **Commit** | `abc1234` |\n| **Version** | `0.0.2-pr.123.abc1234` |\n| **Built** | Dec 10, 2025 at 3:45 PM UTC |\n\n### Quick Install\n\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardgill/patchy/main/install | bash -s -- --pr 123\n\n### Direct Downloads\n\n| Platform | Architecture | Download |\n|----------|--------------|----------|\n| Linux | x64 | [patchy-linux-x64.tar.gz](https://github.com/.../releases/download/pr-123/...) |\n| Linux | arm64 | [patchy-linux-arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/.../releases/download/pr-123/...) |\n| macOS | Intel | [patchy-darwin-x64.zip](https://github.com/.../releases/download/pr-123/...) |\n| macOS | Apple Silicon | [patchy-darwin-arm64.zip](https://github.com/.../releases/download/pr-123/...) |\n| Windows | x64 | [patchy-windows-x64.zip](https://github.com/.../releases/download/pr-123/...) |\n\n---\n*This comment updates automatically with each push.*\n```\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Existing Infrastructure\n\n**Install Script** (`install`):\n- Supports `VERSION=x.x.x` env var for specific versions\n- Downloads from `https://github.com/richardgill/patchy/releases/download/v${version}/...`\n- Handles platform detection (linux/darwin/windows, x64/arm64)\n- Already has archive extraction logic (tar.gz for Linux, zip for macOS/Windows)\n\n**Build System** (`scripts/build.ts`):\n- Builds 5 targets: linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64, windows-x64\n- Injects version via `PATCHY_VERSION` environment variable\n- Outputs to `dist/\u003cname\u003e/bin/patchy[.exe]`\n\n**Release Workflow** (`publish.yml`):\n- Creates archives: `patchy-\u003cplatform\u003e.tar.gz` or `.zip`\n- Generates `checksums.txt`\n- Uses `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe install script already supports versioned downloads - we just need:\n1. A `--pr \u003cnumber\u003e` flag to download from PR releases\n2. PR releases with tag format `pr-\u003cnumber\u003e` (not `v\u003cversion\u003e`)\n\n## Desired End State\n\n1. **Every PR push** creates/updates a GitHub pre-release tagged `pr-\u003cnumber\u003e`\n2. **Sticky PR comment** shows download instructions (updated on each push)\n3. **Install script** supports `--pr 123` flag for one-command installation\n4. **PR merge/close** automatically deletes the pre-release (keeps releases page clean)\n\n### Version Format\n\nPR builds use: `\u003cbase-version\u003e-pr.\u003cpr-number\u003e.\u003cshort-sha\u003e`\n\nExample: `0.0.2-pr.123.abc1234`\n\nThis follows [SemVer pre-release](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9) conventions.\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- Workflow artifacts (require GitHub login, no stable URLs)\n- External storage (unnecessary complexity)\n- Nightly builds (not requested)\n- npm publishing for PRs\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: PR Release Workflow\n\n### Overview\n\nCreate a workflow that builds binaries and publishes them as a GitHub pre-release on every PR push.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1.

Update install script\n\n**File**: `install`\n\nAdd PR support near the top after the existing variables:\n\n```bash\n# Near line 13, after: requested_version=${VERSION:-}\nrequested_pr=${PR:-}\n\n# Parse command line arguments\nwhile [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do\n  case $1 in\n    --pr)\n      requested_pr=\"$2\"\n      shift 2\n      ;;\n    --version)\n      requested_version=\"$2\"\n      shift 2\n      ;;\n    *)\n      echo -e \"${RED}Unknown option: $1${NC}\"\n      exit 1\n      ;;\n  esac\ndone\n```\n\nUpdate the download URL logic (around line 79):\n\n```bash\n# Determine download URL\nif [ -n \"$requested_pr\" ]; then\n  # PR build - uses pr-\u003cnumber\u003e tag format\n  url=\"https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/pr-${requested_pr}/$filename\"\n  specific_version=\"pr-${requested_pr}\"\n  print_message info \"${MUTED}Installing PR #${requested_pr} preview build${NC}\"\nelif [ -z \"$requested_version\" ]; then\n  url=\"https://github.com/$REPO/releases/latest/download/$filename\"\n  specific_version=$(curl -s \"https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/releases/latest\" | sed -n 's/.*\"tag_name\": *\"v\\([^\"]*\\)\".*/\\1/p')\n\n  if [[ $? -ne 0 || -z \"$specific_version\" ]]; then\n    echo -e \"${RED}Failed to fetch version information${NC}\"\n    exit 1\n  fi\nelse\n  url=\"https://github.com/$REPO/releases/download/v${requested_version}/$filename\"\n  specific_version=$requested_version\nfi\n```\n\nUpdate the success message at the end to handle PR installs:\n\n```bash\n# Around line 193, update the success message\necho \"\"\nprint_message success \"Installation complete!\"\necho \"\"\nif [ -n \"$requested_pr\" ]; then\n  echo -e \"${MUTED}Installed PR #${requested_pr} preview build${NC}\"\n  echo -e \"${MUTED}Note: This is a pre-release build for testing.${NC}\"\n  echo \"\"\nfi\necho -e \"${MUTED}To get started:${NC}\"\necho \"\"\necho -e \"  ${GREEN}patchy --help${NC}\"\necho \"\"\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Script syntax is valid: `bash -n install`\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] `curl -fsSL .../install | bash -s -- --pr 123` installs the PR build\n- [ ] `PR=123 curl -fsSL .../install | bash` also works (env var)\n- [ ] Installed binary shows PR version\n- [ ] Regular install (no --pr flag) still works\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, pause for manual verification before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Cleanup on PR Close\n\n### Overview\n\nAutomatically delete PR pre-releases when the PR is merged or closed to keep the releases page clean.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Create cleanup workflow\n\n**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-release-cleanup.yml`\n\n```yaml\nname: PR Release Cleanup\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    types: [closed]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  cleanup:\n    name: Delete PR Release\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Delete PR release and tag\n        run: |\n          PR_NUMBER=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n          TAG=\"pr-${PR_NUMBER}\"\n\n          echo \"Cleaning up release for PR #${PR_NUMBER}...\"\n\n          # Delete the release (if exists)\n          gh release delete \"$TAG\" --repo \"${{ github.repository }}\" --yes || echo \"No release to delete\"\n\n          # Delete the tag (if exists)\n          gh api --method DELETE \"/repos/${{ github.repository }}/git/refs/tags/${TAG}\" || echo \"No tag to delete\"\n\n          echo \"Cleanup complete\"\n        env:\n          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] Workflow YAML is valid\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] Merge a test PR\n- [ ] Verify the `pr-\u003cnumber\u003e` release is deleted\n- [ ] Verify the `pr-\u003cnumber\u003e` tag is deleted\n- [ ] Close (without merge) another test PR and verify cleanup\n\n**Implementation Note**: After completing this phase, pause for manual verification.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: Integration with Existing CI\n\n### Overview\n\nEnsure PR releases only happen after checks pass, and update documentation.\n\n### Changes Required\n\n#### 1. Add dependency on checks (optional enhancement)\n\nIf we want PR releases to only happen after lint/typecheck/test pass, we can make `pr-release.yml` depend on `pre-checks.yml`:\n\n```yaml\n# In pr-release.yml, add at the top of jobs section:\njobs:\n  checks:\n    uses: ./.github/workflows/pre-checks.yml\n    secrets: inherit\n\n  build-and-release:\n    name: Build \u0026 Release\n    needs: checks\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    # ... rest of job\n```\n\n**Decision**: This is optional. Building before checks complete lets users test faster, but might publish broken builds. Recommend adding the dependency for safety.\n\n#### 2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md (if exists)\n\nAdd section about PR previews:\n\n```markdown\n## Testing PR Builds\n\nEvery pull request automatically publishes preview binaries. To test a PR:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Install PR build (replace 123 with the PR number)\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richardgill/patchy/main/install | bash -s -- --pr 123\n\n# Or download directly from the PR's release page\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nPreview builds are automatically deleted when the PR is merged or closed.\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n#### Automated Verification:\n- [ ] CI passes with new workflow dependencies\n\n#### Manual Verification:\n- [ ] End-to-end flow works: push → checks → release → comment\n- [ ] Documentation is clear\n\n---\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Automated Tests\n\nThe existing CI validates:\n- Build compiles for all platforms\n- Lint, typecheck, and tests pass\n\n### Manual Testing Checklist\n\n1. **Create test PR**\n   - [ ] Push a commit\n   - [ ] Wait for workflow to complete\n   - [ ] Verify sticky comment appears\n\n2. **Verify downloads**\n   - [ ] Click direct download link → downloads without login\n   - [ ] Run `curl ... | bash -s -- --pr \u003cnumber\u003e` → installs correctly\n   - [ ] Run `patchy --version` → shows `x.x.x-pr.\u003cnumber\u003e.\u003csha\u003e`\n\n3. **Verify updates**\n   - [ ] Push another commit to same PR\n   - [ ] Verify comment updates (same comment, new SHA)\n   - [ ] Verify release assets update\n\n4. **Verify cleanup**\n   - [ ] Merge the PR\n   - [ ] Verify release is deleted from releases page\n   - [ ] Verify tag is deleted\n\n5. **Verify existing install still works**\n   - [ ] `curl ... | bash` (no flags) installs latest stable\n   - [ ] `VERSION=x.x.x curl ... | bash` installs specific version\n\n## File Summary\n\n| File | Action | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `.github/workflows/pr-release.yml` | Create | Build and publish PR pre-releases |\n| `.github/workflows/pr-release-cleanup.yml` | Create | Delete releases on PR close |\n| `install` | Modify | Add `--pr \u003cnumber\u003e` flag support |\n| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Modify | Document PR preview feature |\n\n## References\n\n- [Vercel PR comment format](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github) - Inspiration for sticky comment design\n- [Netlify deploy previews](https://docs.netlify.com/deploy/deploy-types/deploy-previews/) - Similar UX pattern\n- [marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment](https://github.com/marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment) - GitHub Action for sticky comments\n- [softprops/action-gh-release](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release) - GitHub Action for releases\n- [SemVer pre-release format](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9) - Version naming convention\n- Current install script: `install`\n- Current release workflow: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-10T18:08:40.147045294Z","updated_at":"2025-12-11T12:31:42.723826546Z","closed_at":"2025-12-11T12:31:42.723826546Z"}

Users can install via:\n- `npm install patchy-cli` (stable)\n- `npm install patchy-cli@pr-123` (PR preview)\n\nUses platform-specific packages (`patchy-cli-linux-x64`, etc.) with a thin Node.js wrapper that finds and executes the correct binary at runtime.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### What exists:\n- Binary builds for 5 platforms via `scripts/build.ts`\n- PR workflow publishes to GitHub Releases with tag `pr-{number}`\n- Main workflow uses changesets, publishes to GitHub Releases\n- Build script already generates platform-specific `package.json` files (but missing `publishConfig`)\n\n### What's missing:\n- Node.js shim (`bin/patchy`) to find and run the correct binary\n- `optionalDependencies` in root `package.json`\n- npm publish steps in workflows\n- NPM_TOKEN secret in GitHub\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter implementation:\n1. Every PR push publishes to npm with version `X.X.X-pr.{number}.{sha}` and tag `pr-{number}`\n2. Every main release (via changesets) publishes to npm with `latest` tag\n3.

{"id":"patchy-60","title":"DRY up src/config/types.ts by deriving types from CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA","description":"# DRY Refactoring of src/config/types.ts\n\n## Overview\n\nRefactor `src/config/types.ts` to derive core config types from `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA`, eliminating manual duplication while keeping flag types explicit for readability.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\nThe file has the same fields defined in 3 different casings:\n- `SharedFlags`: kebab-case (`\"repo-url\"`, `\"repo-dir\"`)\n- `CompleteJsonConfig`: snake_case (`repo_url`, `repo_dir`)\n- `CamelCaseResolvedConfig`: camelCase (`repoUrl`, `repoDir`)\n\nPlus `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` which maps between all of them.\n\n### Key Discoveries:\n- `CompleteJsonConfig` is only used within `types.ts` to derive `JsonKey` and `ResolvedConfig`\n- `CamelCaseResolvedConfig` is only used within `types.ts` (and its Partial variant)\n- `JsonKey` is used in `resolver.ts` for generic constraints\n- `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` is already the source of truth for mappings\n- `SharedFlags` has 8 properties, mostly matching metadata but also includes `config` which is NOT in metadata\n\n### Important Constraint:\n`SharedFlags` includes `config?: string` which is NOT in `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA`. This is intentional - the config path is handled separately from the config values themselves.\n\n## Desired End State\n\nAfter refactoring:\n1. `JsonKey` derived from `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` keys\n2. `CompleteJsonConfig` derived from metadata using type inference\n3. `CamelCaseResolvedConfig` derived using a `SnakeToCamel` utility type\n4. `SharedFlags` remains explicit (includes `config` which isn't in metadata, and deriving it would be ugly)\n5. Command flag types remain explicit (they're semantic with Pick patterns)\n6. All tests pass, no runtime behavior changes\n\n### Verification:\n- `bun run test` passes\n- `bun run typecheck` passes\n- Type inference works correctly in VSCode/IDE\n\n## What We're NOT Doing\n\n- NOT changing `SharedFlags` to be derived (it includes `config` which isn't in metadata)\n- NOT changing command-specific flag types (they use `Pick` patterns meaningfully)\n- NOT changing `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` structure\n- NOT changing runtime behavior\n- NOT touching `schemas.ts` (it has its own Zod-based types)\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\nUse TypeScript's type inference to derive types from the `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` const object.\n\n## Phase 1: Add Utility Types and Derive Config Types\n\n### Overview\nAdd type utilities and refactor the derived types while keeping explicit types unchanged.\n\n### Changes Required:\n\n#### 1. src/config/types.ts\n\n**Move `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` above the types that will derive from it**\n\nThe const must be defined before types that reference it.\n\n**Add SnakeToCamel utility type:**\n\n\\`\\`\\`typescript\ntype SnakeToCamel\u003cS extends string\u003e = S extends \\`\\${infer H}_\\${infer T}\\`\n  ? \\`\\${H}\\${Capitalize\u003cSnakeToCamel\u003cT\u003e\u003e}\\`\n  : S;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Derive JsonKey from metadata:**\n\n\\`\\`\\`typescript\n// Before:\nexport type JsonKey = keyof CompleteJsonConfig;\n\n// After:\nexport type JsonKey = keyof typeof CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA;\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Derive CompleteJsonConfig from metadata:**\n\n\\`\\`\\`typescript\n// Before:\nexport type CompleteJsonConfig = {\n  repo_url: string;\n  ref: string;\n  repo_base_dir: string;\n  repo_dir: string;\n  patches_dir: string;\n  verbose: boolean;\n  dry_run: boolean;\n};\n\n// After:\nexport type CompleteJsonConfig = {\n  [K in JsonKey]: (typeof CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA)[K][\"type\"] extends \"boolean\"\n    ? boolean\n    : string;\n};\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Derive CamelCaseResolvedConfig from CompleteJsonConfig:**\n\n\\`\\`\\`typescript\n// Before:\nexport type CamelCaseResolvedConfig = {\n  repoUrl: string;\n  repoDir: string;\n  repoBaseDir: string;\n  patchesDir: string;\n  ref: string;\n  verbose: boolean;\n  dryRun: boolean;\n};\n\n// After:\nexport type CamelCaseResolvedConfig = {\n  [K in JsonKey as SnakeToCamel\u003cK\u003e]: CompleteJsonConfig[K];\n};\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Update CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA satisfies clause:**\n\nThe satisfies clause references `JsonKey` and `SharedFlags`, but now `JsonKey` is derived from the metadata itself.

{"id":"patchy-62","title":"DRY up config types by making CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA single source of truth","description":"## Goal\n\nMake `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA` the single source of truth for all config-related definitions, eliminating duplication across:\n- `src/config/types.ts` - TypeScript types + metadata\n- `src/config/schemas.ts` - Zod validation schemas  \n- `src/commands/shared-parameters.ts` - Stricli CLI flags\n- `src/constants.ts` - Env var exports\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### Step 1: Expand CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA in types.ts\nAdd `brief` field for CLI descriptions. Keep env vars inline (not imported from constants). Also add `CONFIG_FLAG_METADATA` for the special `config` flag.\n\n### Step 2: Generate Zod schemas in schemas.ts\nUse `buildZodField()` helper to generate schemas from metadata instead of hardcoding field names.\n\n### Step 3: Generate CLI flags in shared-parameters.ts\nUse `buildFlag()` helper to generate Stricli flags from metadata. Keep `applyFlags` and `yesFlag` as explicit additions.\n\n### Step 4: Update constants.ts\nDerive env var exports from metadata for backwards compatibility:\n```typescript\nexport const PATCHY_REPO_URL_ENV_VAR = CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA.repo_url.env;\n```\n\n### Step 5: Update imports in types.ts\nRemove env var imports from constants, since they're now inline in metadata.\n\n### Step 6: Update checkout/command.ts\nReplace `PATCHY_REF_ENV_VAR` import with `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA.ref.env`.\n\n### Step 7: Update clone/impl.ts\nReplace `PATCHY_REPO_BASE_DIR_ENV_VAR` import with `CONFIG_FIELD_METADATA.repo_base_dir.env`.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| `src/config/types.ts` | Expand metadata with `brief`, add `CONFIG_FLAG_METADATA` |\n| `src/config/schemas.ts` | Generate Zod schemas from metadata |\n| `src/commands/shared-parameters.ts` | Generate CLI flags from metadata |\n| `src/constants.ts` | Derive from metadata |\n| `src/commands/repo/checkout/command.ts` | Use metadata for env var |\n| `src/commands/repo/clone/impl.ts` | Use metadata for env var |\n\n## Verification\n\n```bash\n# 1.

Remove absolute path computation from `createMergedConfig` (lines 164-171)\n2.
