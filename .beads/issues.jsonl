Users should be prompted to confirm before this happens.\n\n## Proposed Behavior\n\n```\n$ patchy repo reset --repo-base-dir repos --repo-dir my-repo\nThis will discard all uncommitted changes in repos/my-repo. Continue? [y/N]\n```\n\n## Flags (following Vercel CLI pattern)\n\n- `--yes` / `-y` - Skip confirmation prompt and proceed\n- Could also respect `--dry-run` to show what would be reset without prompting\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Add `yes` flag to `src/commands/repo/reset/command.ts`\n2. Add `YesCommandFlags` or extend `ResetCommandFlags` in `src/config/types.ts`\n3. Update `src/commands/repo/reset/impl.ts:68` to prompt before `git.reset([\"--hard\"])`\n4. Use `enquirer` (already a dependency) for the prompt\n\n## Example from Vercel CLI\n\n```\n$ vercel rm my-project\n\u003e The project \"my-project\" will be removed permanently.\n?
